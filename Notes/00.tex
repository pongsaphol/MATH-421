\chapter{Method of Proof}
\section{Direct proof}
some statements can be shown to be true through a direct arguement e.g. our proof of Theorem 1
\begin{theorem}
    hello
\end{theorem}
\section{Proof by induction}
the aim is to proof that a statement is true for all rational number
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Show the statement is true for $n=1$
    \item Assume the statement is true for general $n\in \NN$
    \item Using assumption (ii), prove the statement is true for $n+1$
    \item Conclude your proof with a sentence like "by mathematical information, the result holds for all $n\in \NN$"
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
    Show that $\sqrt{2} \in \RR\setminus\QQ$
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $x\in \RR$ and $n \in \NN$. Then, there holds the formula
    $$(1+x)^n=\sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j}x^j$$
\end{theorem}
